# **Plant Disease Detection**

**Plant Disease Detection** is a project aimed at automating the detection and diagnosis of plant diseases using machine learning techniques. By leveraging image processing and deep learning algorithms, the project helps farmers and agronomists identify diseases in crops accurately and efficiently.

## **Features**

1. **Image Classification**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify plant images into healthy or diseased categories.
   
2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Supports detection and classification of multiple types of plant diseases, providing detailed insights into the health status of crops.
   
3. **Real-Time Detection**: Offers real-time disease detection capabilities, enabling farmers to promptly respond to disease outbreaks.
   
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing diagnosis results.
   
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Designed to be compatible with mobile devices, allowing farmers to access the application conveniently from their smartphones.
